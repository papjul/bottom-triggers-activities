# Bottom Triggers Activities
This is a fork of Dash to Dock which allows to trigger Activities overview when putting the mouse on bottom of the screen.
It adds support for Gnome Shell 40.

All credits goes to Dash to Dock, I only simplified their code for my use case.

I may backport fixes from upstream but I don't intend to add any new feature or fix any bug if I'm not affected.
